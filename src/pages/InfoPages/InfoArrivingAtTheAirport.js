            are there so we know we are in communication.
            <br /> Then, just before you exit the airport, let us know you have
            exited, so we know to schedule a boat for you.

            In case the Internet doesn't work well, call us at 416-479-0199 or

            Take a taxi to our dock location at Elizabeth on Bay Marketplace (on
            the corner of Bay St and Elizabeth Ave). The cost of the taxi will
            be approximately $30 (plus surcharge for more than 2 persons). You
            can pay for the taxi with American or Bahamian dollars (you can use
            either currency throughout the Bahamas and at the ashram).

            Our boat will pick you up at Elizabeth on Bay Marketplace and take
            you to the ashram, a 5-minute boat ride across the bay from the dock
            in Nassau. While there is a regular boat schedule, we will do our
            best to ensure that our boat meets you at the dock in a timely
            manner so you do not have to wait long.

            CLOTHING As the ashram is a spiritual community and study center, we
            ask that clothing be respectable and modest. Guests are invited to
            dress in casual, comfortable clothes suitable for warm days and cool
            evenings. Around the ashram, summer attire is completely
            appropriate, including shorts, skirts, and summer tops (although
            halter tops, low necklines, and short shorts and mini-skirts are
            not). Of course, bathing suits are worn on the beach; we simply ask
            that you wear a cover-up on the way to the beach. In satsang and the
            temples, knees and shoulders should be covered; we recommend
            bringing a meditation shawl.

          <Typography variant="body1">
            Once you have landed at the ashram, you will meet our lovely
            receptionists.
            <br />
            ...show images of the path, some nice signs along the way...
            <br />
            The check in process involves scanning your passport, confirming
            your details, and showing you to your room. (all payments are
            handled 14 days prior to arrival)
            <br />
          </Typography>
          <Typography variant="body1">
            The room check in time is scheduled for 15:00, and checkout time is
            at 11:00. So housekeeping starts their cleaning round at 11:00.
            <br />
            Since we take into account the expected arrival time of each guest,
            we generally have most of the rooms ready for everyone on time. If
            you arrive before 12:00, you might have to wait, but in most days
            you can expect coming into your room within a short time. The
            official check in time is 15:00, so don't be mad if it's not
            clean............ we might always run into some difficulties and we
            take this time as a reasonable safety margin.
          </Typography>
          <Typography variant="h2">Checkout</Typography>
          <Typography variant="body1">
            Checkout time is at 11:00, and we ask you to give us your room keys
            by that time. Housekeeping might need to enter into your room at
            11:00 to have it ready for the next guest. If there is no other
            guest coming into your room, you can ask for a late checkout for any
            time up to 15:00, which costs $25 + tax. We can only process late
            checkout request on the day before or day of departure

            We usually coordinate a boat and taxi for you for your departure....

            We will remind you of that before you check out. You can book your

            In case you are moving rooms during your stay, please note that we
            ask you to checkout of your previous room, we will have a place for
            your to store your belongings, and only when your next room is ready
            you can enter it. Housekeeping prioritizes the rooms for people who
            move between rooms, so usually you would not wait more than an hour
            without a room, but it might extend up at 15:00.
