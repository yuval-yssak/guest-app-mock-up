        <Paragraph>
          If you have Internet connection at the airport (Sometimes the WiFi
          works well and sometimes it doesn't, and many people have mobile
          data), hopefully you do. In this case, chat with us as soon as you are
          there so we know we are in communication.
          <br /> Then, just before you exit the airport, let us know you have
          exited, so we know to schedule a boat for you.
          <br />
          In case the Internet doesn't work well, call us at 416-479-0199 or
          local call: 363-2902 to make sure we know to schedule a boat for you.

          Take a taxi to our dock location at Elizabeth on Bay Marketplace (on
          the corner of Bay St and Elizabeth Ave). The cost of the taxi will be
          approximately $30 (plus surcharge for more than 2 persons). You can
          pay for the taxi with American or Bahamian dollars (you can use either
          currency throughout the Bahamas and at the ashram).
        </Paragraph>
        <Paragraph>
          Our boat will pick you up at Elizabeth on Bay Marketplace and take you
          to the ashram, a 5-minute boat ride across the bay from the dock in
          Nassau. While there is a regular boat schedule, we will do our best to
          ensure that our boat meets you at the dock in a timely manner so you
          do not have to wait long.

          In case you have Internet connection (at the point of waiting for the
          boat there is no WiFi service available), you can always communicate
          with us to let us know the taxi has dropped you off and you are ready
          to meet our boatman.
          <br />
          You can also send a text message a few minutes before leaving the
          taxi...

        <Heading2>What to bring?</Heading2>
        <Heading3>Clothing</Heading3>
        <Paragraph>
          As the ashram is a spiritual community and study center, we ask that
          clothing be respectable and modest. Guests are invited to dress in
          casual, comfortable clothes suitable for warm days and cool evenings.
          Around the ashram, summer attire is completely appropriate, including
          shorts, skirts, and summer tops (although halter tops, low necklines,
          and short shorts and mini-skirts are not). Of course, bathing suits
          are worn on the beach; we simply ask that you wear a cover-up on the
          way to the beach. In satsang and the temples, knees and shoulders
          should be covered; we recommend bringing a meditation shawl.
        </Paragraph>
        <Heading3>Other items to pack</Heading3>
        <Paragraph>
          Yoga mat (also available on-site to rent or buy); beach towel (they
          are not provided); meditation cushion (optional), toiletries
          (including soap), slip-on sandals, rainwear, flashlight, insect
          repellent, alarm clock, insulated travel mug, water bottle, and
          sunscreen. You may also wish to bring snorkeling equipment. Some
          guests bring dry snack foods, such as nuts and energy bars.

          herbal tea selection.

        <Heading2>The Check in process</Heading2>
        <Paragraph>
          Once you have landed at the ashram, you will meet our lovely
          receptionists.
          <br />
          ...show images of the path, some nice signs along the way...
          <br />
          The check in process involves scanning your passport, confirming your
          details, and showing you to your room. (all payments are handled 14
          days prior to arrival)
          <br />
        </Paragraph>
        <Paragraph>
          The room check in time is scheduled for 15:00, and checkout time is at
          11:00. So housekeeping starts their cleaning round at 11:00.
          <br />
          Since we take into account the expected arrival time of each guest, we
          generally have most of the rooms ready for everyone on time. If you
          arrive before 12:00, you might have to wait, but in most days you can
          expect coming into your room within a short time. The official check
          in time is 15:00, so don't be mad if it's not clean............ we
          might always run into some difficulties and we take this time as a
          reasonable safety margin.
        </Paragraph>
        <Heading3>Checkout</Heading3>
        <Paragraph>
          Checkout time is at 11:00, and we ask you to give us your room keys by
          that time. Housekeeping might need to enter into your room at 11:00 to
          have it ready for the next guest. If there is no other guest coming
          into your room, you can ask for a late checkout for any time up to
          15:00, which costs $25 + tax. We can only process late checkout
          request on the day before or day of departure
        </Paragraph>
        <Heading3>Preparing to checkout</Heading3>
        <Paragraph>
          We usually coordinate a boat and taxi for you for your departure....
          <br />
          We will remind you of that before you check out. You can book your
          taxi <Link href="#">here</Link>.
        </Paragraph>
        <Heading3>Room move</Heading3>
        <Paragraph>
          In case you are moving rooms during your stay, please note that we ask
          you to checkout of your previous room, we will have a place for your
          to store your belongings, and only when your next room is ready you
          can enter it. Housekeeping prioritizes the rooms for people who move
          between rooms, so usually you would not wait more than an hour without
          a room, but it might extend up at 15:00.
