        <Heading2>Five Points Points of Yoga</Heading2>
        <Paragraph>
          The Yogi sees life as a triangle; the body undergoes birth, growth,
          decay, and death. The growth period reaches a plateau at about the age
          of 18-20 years. In the first years of life, the “youthful” period, the
          rate of cell rejuvenation (anabolic) exceeds the rate of cell decay
          (catabolic). In a normal person, the body maintains an equilibrium of
          these processes from the age of 20 until around the age of 35, when
          the decaying, or catabolic process, begins to gain precedence. The
          body machine starts its decline. This process later results in “old
          age” with its accompanying ills and despair. However, the Yogis say
          that we were not born merely to be subject to pain and suffering,
          disease and death. There is a far greater purpose to Life. But, the
          spiritual investigation of Life’s purposes requires a keen intellect
          and a strong will; these are the products of a healthy body and mind.
          For this reason, the ancient sages developed an integral system to
          ward off or retard the decaying or catabolic process, and to keep the
          physical and mental faculties strong. This is the system of Yoga, a
          simple and natural programme involving five main principles:

          Yoga is a life of self-discipline based on the tenets of “simple
          living and high thinking.” <br />
          The body is a temple or a vehicle for the soul, and has specific
          requirements which must be fulfilled for it to function smoothly and
          supply the optimum mileage. These requirements are the same as for any
          vehicle. An automobile requires five things: a lubricating system; a
          battery; a cooling system; fuel; and a responsible driver behind the
          wheel. Now let us look at the human needs.
        </LeadText>
        <Heading4>Proper Exercise</Heading4>
        <Paragraph>
          acts as a lubricating routine to the joints, muscles, ligaments,
          tendons, and other parts of the body by increasing circulation and
          flexibility. (For further details, see chapter 4 of The Complete
          Illustrated Book of Yoga by Swami Vishnu-devanananda).
        </Paragraph>
        <Heading4> Proper Breathing</Heading4>
        <Paragraph>
          aids the body in connecting to its battery, the Solar Plexus, where
          tremendous potential energy is stored. When tapped through specific
          Yoga breathing techniques (Pranayama), this energy is released for
          physical and mental rejuvenation (see chapter 8 of The Complete
          Illustrated Book of Yoga).

        <Heading4> Proper Relaxation</Heading4>
        <Paragraph>
          cools down the system, as does the radiator of a car, When the body
          and mind are continually overworked, their efficiency diminishes.
          Relaxation is Nature’s way of recharging the body (see chapter 6 of
          The Complete Illustrated Book of Yoga)

          provides the correct fuel for the body. Optimum utilization of food,
          air, water, and sunlight is essential (see chapter 7 of The Complete

          puts you in control. The intellect is purified. The lower nature is
          brought under conscious control through steadiness and concentration
          of the mind. (See Meditation and Mantras by Swami Vishnu-devananda)
        </Paragraph>

        <Heading2>1 Proper Exercise</Heading2>
        <Heading3>Asanas</Heading3>
        <Paragraph>
          There are numerous modern physical culture systems designed to develop
          the muscles through mechanical movements and exercises. As Yoga
          regards the body as a vehicle for the soul in its journey towards
          perfection, Asanas (Yogic physical exercise) are designed to develop
          not only the body. They also broaden the mental faculties and the
          spiritual capacities. The fundamental difference between Yogic
          exercises and ordinary physical exercises is that physical culture
          emphasizes violent movement of the muscles; whereas Yogix exercises
          oppose violent muscle movements as they produce large quantities of
          lactic acid in the muscle fibres, thus causing fatigue. When
          practicing asanas, the effect of excess acid and the fatigue it causes
          are neutralized by the alkali in the muscle fibres, as well as by the
          inhalation of oxygen (deep breathing). Muscle development does not
          necessarily mean a healthy body, as is commonly assumed. Health is a
          state wherein all organs function perfectly under the intelligent
          control of the mind. The Yogic physical exercises are called “Asanas,”
          a term which means steady pose. This is because the Yogic Asana (or
          posture) is meant to be held for some time. However, this is quite an
          advanced practice. Initially, our concern is simply to increase body
          flexibility. Your body is as young as it is flexible. Yoga exercises
          focus first on the health of the spine, its strength and flexibility.
          The spinal column houses the all-important nervous system, the
          telegraphic system of the body. By maintaining the spine’s flexibility
          and strength through exercise, circulation is increased and the nerves
          are ensured their supply of nutrients and oxygen. Asanas work on the
          integral machinery of the body, the glands and organs, as well as the
          muscles. They affect the deeper and more subtle parts of the body. The
          internal organs receive massage and stimulation through the various
          movements of the Asanas, and are toned into more efficient
          functioning. The endocrine system (glands and hormones) is
          rejuvenated, helping to balance the emotions and improve the mental
          outlook on life. Hand in hand with the practice of yoga postures, we
          practice deep breathing and concentration of the mind. One hour of
          practice will give one hour of exercise, one hour of deep relaxation
          and one hour of meditation - through developing the concentration
          powers within the pose. The Yoga system of exercise can be compared to
          none other in its complete rehauling of the entire being. Performed
          slowly and consciously, the Asanas goe far beyond mere physical
          benefits, becoming a mental exercise in concentration and meditation.

        <Heading2>2 Proper Breathing</Heading2>

        <Heading3>Pranayama</Heading3>
        <Paragraph>
          Most people use only a fraction of their lung capacity for breathing.
          They breathe shallowly, barely expanding the ribcage. Their shoulders
          are hunched, they have painful tension in the upper parts of the back
          and neck, and they suffer from lack of oxygen. These people become
          tired easily and don’t know why. Thoughtful management and husbanding
          of breath can be of practical daily aid; it can tone up and contribute
          to health and vitality. Increased vital capacity is the object of all
          breath discipline. Even in a day of escalators and elevators there are
          still stairs to climb. If you tire easily when climbing stairs, try
          this: keeping the shoulder blades in position, inhale as you climb the
          first two steps, and exhale on the next two, you can glide up a flight
          of stairs and arrive on the top without grasping for breath. By
          quickening the breath rhythmically while climbing, we expel a greater
          amount of carbon dioxide and take in a great supply of oxygen, thus
          experiencing less fatigue.
        </Paragraph>

        <Heading4>Breathe to Live</Heading4>
        <Paragraph>
          What the unfortunate majority of us need these days is a breathing
          programme that can help us at our desks, stoves, and machines. Tension
          and even depression may be overcome by the following exercise. Place
          the shoulder blades as close together as you can without strain and
          exhale gently and fully. Pause, and then inhale with a deep, slow,
          gentle breath until the lungs are comfortably filled. Breathe out
          slowly through the nose with a long sigh and without altering the
          position of the shoulder blades. Do this a dozen times and depression
          will disappear. You will have stimulated the brain and eased nerve
          tension by providing a fuller supply of life-giving oxygen. There are
          three basic types of breathing. “Clavicular” breathing is the most
          shallow and worst possible type. The shoulder and collarbone are
          raised while the abdomen is contracted during inhalation. Maximum
          effort is made, but a minimum amount of air is obtained. “Intercostal”
          breathing is done with the rib muscles expanding the rib cage, and is
          the second type of incomplete breathing. “Deep abdominal” breathing is
          the best, for it brings air to the lowest and largest part of the
          lungs. Breathing is slow and deep, and proper use is made of the
          diaphragm. Actually, none of these types are complete. A full Yogic
          breath combines all three, beginning with a deep breath and continuing
          the inhalation through the intercostal and clavicular areas. To get
          the feel of proper diaphragmatic breathing, wear loose clothing and
          lie on the back. Place the hand on the upper abdomen, where the
          diaphragm is located. Breathe in and out slowly. The abdomen should
          expand outward as you inhale and contract as you exhale. Try to get
          the feeling of this motion. Breathe in slowly, expand the abdomen,
          then the ribcage, and finally the upper portion of the lungs. Then,
          breathe out in the same manner, letting the abdomen cave in as you
          exhale. This is the Yogic complete breath.
        </Paragraph>
        <Heading4>Pranayama</Heading4>
        <Paragraph>
          By far the most important thing about good breathing is the Prana, or
          subtle energy of the vital breath. Control of the Prana leads to
          control of the mind. Breathing exercises are called Pranayama, which
          means to control the Prana. The grossest manifestation of Prana in the
          human body is the motion of the lungs. This motion acts like the
          flywheel that sets the other forces of the body in motion. Pranayama
          means controlling this motion of the lungs, by which the subtle Prana
          is controlled. When the subtle Prana is controlled, all other gross
          manifestations of Prana in the body with slowly come under control.
          Every part of the body can be filled with Prana, when we are able to
          do this, the whole body will be under our control. All diseases of the
          body can be destroyed at the root by controlling and regulating the
          Prana; this is the secret knowledge of healing. In ordinary breathing
          we extract Prana only very little. But when we concentrate and
          consciously regulate the breathing, we are able to store a greater
          amount. He who has abundant Pranic energy radiates vitality and
          strength, which can be felt by those coming into contact with him.
        </Paragraph>

        <Heading2>3 Proper Relaxation</Heading2>
        <Heading3>Savasana</Heading3>

        <Paragraph>
          When the body and the mind are constantly overworked, their natural
          efficiency to perform work diminishes. Modern social life, food, work
          and even the so called entertainment, such as disco dancing, make it
          difficult for modern people to relax. Many have even forgotten that
          rest and relaxation are Nature’s way of recharging. Even while trying
          to rest, the average person expends a lot of physical and mental
          energy through tension. Much of the body’s energy is wasted uselessly.
          More of our energy is spent is keeping the muscles in continual
          readiness for work than in the actual useful work done. In order to
          regulate and balance the work of the body and mind, it is best to
          learn to economize the energy produced by our body. This may be done
          by learning to relax.
        </Paragraph>
        <Paragraph>
          It may be remembered that in the course of one day, our body usually
          produces all the substances and energy necessary for the next day. But
          it often happens that all these substances and energy may be consumed
          within a few minutes by bad moods, anger, injury, or intense
          irritation. The process of eruption and repression of violent emotions
          often grows into a regular habit. The result is disastrous not only
          for the body, but also for the mind. During complete relaxation, there
          is practically no energy or “Prana” being consumed, although a little
          is kept in circulation to keep the body in normal condition while the
          remaining portion is being stored and conserved. In order to achieve
          perfect relaxation, three methods are used by Yogis: “physical,”
          “mental” and “spiritual” relaxation. Relaxation is not complete until
          the person reaches that stage of spiritual relaxation, which only
          advanced Spiritual Aspirants know.
        </Paragraph>
        <Heading4>3A Physical Relaxation</Heading4>
        <Paragraph>
          We all know that every action is the result of thought. Thoughts take
          form in action, the body reacting to the thought. Just as the mind may
          send a message to the muscles ordering them to contract, the mind may
          also send another message to bring the relaxation to the tired
          muscles.
        </Paragraph>
        <Paragraph>
          Physical relaxation first begins with the toes and then moves upward.
          The autosuggestion passes through the muscles and reaches the eyes and
          ears at the top. Then, slowly, messages are sent to the kidneys, liver
          and the other internal organs. This relaxation position is known as
          Savasan, or the “Corpse Pose.” (For further reading, please see
          chapter 6 of “The Complete Illustrated Book of Yoga” by Swami
          Vishnu-devananda).
        </Paragraph>
        <Heading4>3B Mental Relaxation</Heading4>
        <Paragraph>
          When experiencing mental tension, it is advisable to breathe slowly
          and rhythmically for a few minutes. Soon the mind will become calm.
          You may experience a kind of floating sensation.
        </Paragraph>
        <Heading4>3C Spiritual Relaxation</Heading4>
        <Paragraph>
          However one may try to relax the mind, all tensions and worries cannot
          be completely removed until one reaches spiritual relaxation. As long
          as a person identifies with the body and mind, there will be worries,
          sorrows, anxieties, fear and anger. These emotions, in turn, bring
          tension. Yogis know that unless a person can withdraw from the
          body/mind idea and separate himself from the ego-consciousness, there
          is no way of obtaining completion relaxation.
        </Paragraph>
        <Paragraph>
          The Yogi identifies himself with the all-pervading, all-powerful,
          all-peaceful and joyful Self, or pure Consciousness within. He knows
          that the source of all power, knowledge, peace, and strength is in the
          Self, not in the body. We tune to this by asserting the real nature,
          that is “I am that pure Consciousness or Self.” This identification
          with the Self completes the process of relaxation.
        </Paragraph>

        <Heading2>4 Proper Diet</Heading2>
        <Heading3>Vegetarian</Heading3>
        <Paragraph>
          The Yogic diet is a vegetarian one, consisting of pure, simple,
          natural foods which are easily digested and promote health. Simple
          meals aid the digestion and assimilation of foods. Nutritional
          requirements fall under five categories: protein, carbohydrates,
          minerals, fats and vitamins. One should have a certain knowledge of
          dietetics in order to balance their diet. Eating foods first-hand from
          nature, grown in fertile soil (preferably organic, free from chemicals
          and pesticides) will help ensure a better supply of these nutritional
          needs. Processing, refining, and overcooking destroy much food value.
        </Paragraph>
        <Paragraph>
          There is a cycle in Nature known as the “food cycle” or “food chain”.
          The Sun is the source of energy for all life on our planet; it
          nourished the plants (the top of the food chain) which are then eaten
          by animals (vegetarian), which are then eaten by other animals
          (carnivores).
        </Paragraph>
        <Paragraph>
          The food at the top of the food chain, being directly nourished by the
          Sun, has the greatest life promoting properties. The food value of
          animal flesh is termed a “second-hand” source of nutrition, and is
          inferior in nature. All natural foods (fruits, vegetables, seeds, nuts
          and grains) have, in varying quantities, different proportions of
          these essential nutrients.
        </Paragraph>
        <Paragraph>
          As a source of protein, these are easily assimilated by the body.
          However, second-hand sources are often more difficult to digest and
          are of less value to the body’s metabolism.
        </Paragraph>
        <Paragraph>
          Many people worry about whether they are getting enough protein, but
          neglect other factors. The quality of the protein is more important
          than the quantity alone. Dairy products, legumes, nuts and seeds
          provide the vegetarian with an adequate supply of protein. The high
          protein requirement still being used by many Health Departments is
          based on antiquated data and has been scientifically disproved many
          times in the laboratory.
        </Paragraph>
        <Paragraph>
          A healthy motto is: “Eat to live, not live to eat.” It is best if we
          understand that the purpose of eating is to supply our being with the
          lifeforce, or Prana, the vital life energy. So the greatest
          nutritional plan for the Yoga student is the simple diet of natural
          fresh foods.
        </Paragraph>
        <Paragraph>
          However, the true Yogic diet is actually even more selective than
          this. The Yogi is concerned with the subtle effect that food has on
          his mind and astral body. He therefore avoids foods which are overly
          stimulating, preferring those which rener the mind calme and the
          intellect sharp. One who seriously takes to the path of Yoga would
          avoid ingesting meats, fish, eggs, garlic, coffee, tea (except
          herbal), alcohol and drugs.
        </Paragraph>
        <Paragraph>
          Any change in diet should be made gradually. Start by substituting
          larger portions of vegetables, grains, seeds and nuts until finally
          all flesh products have been completely eliminated from the diet.
        </Paragraph>
        <Paragraph>
          The Yogic diet will help you to attain a high standard of health, keen
          intellect and serenity of mind.

        <ol>
          <li>
            Regularity of time, place and practice are most important.
            Regularity conditions the mind to slow down its activities with a
            minimum of delay
          </li>
          <li>
            The most effective times are early dawn and dusk, when the
            atmosphere is charged with special spiritual force. If it is not
            feasible to sit for meditation at these times, choose an hour when
            you are not involved with daily activities, and a time the mind is
            apt to be calm.
          </li>
          <li>
            Try to have a separate room for meditation. As meditation is
            repeated, the powerful vibrations set up will be lodged in the area;
            an atmosphere of peace and purity will be felt.
          </li>
          <li>
            When sitting, face North or East in order to take advantage of
            favorable magnetic vibrations. Sit in a steady, cross-legged
            position with spine and neck erect but not tense.
          </li>
          <li>
            Before beginning, command the mind to be quiet for a specific length
            of time. Forget the past, present and future.
          </li>
          <li>
            Consciously regulate the breath. Begin with five minutes of deep
            abdominal breathing to bring oxygen to the brain. Then slow it down
            to an imperceptible rate.
          </li>
          <li>
            Keep the breathing rhythmic. Inhale for three seconds and exhale for
            three seconds. Regulation of breath also regulates the flow of
            Prana, the vital energy.
          </li>
          <li>
            Allow the mind to wander at first. It will jump around, but will
            eventually become concentrated, along with the concentration of
            Prana.
          </li>
          <li>
            Do not force the mind to be still, as this will set in motion
            additional brain waves, hindering meditation.
          </li>
          <li>
            Select a focal point on which the mind may rest. For people who are
            intellectual by nature, this may be the Ajna Chakra, the point
            between the eyebrows. For more emotional people, use the Anahata or
            Heart Chakra. Never change this focal point.

            Focus on a neutral or uplifting object, holding the image in place
            of concentration. If using a Mantra, repeat it mentally, and
            co-ordinate repetition with the breath. If you do not have a
            personalized Mantra, use OM. although mental repetition is stronger,
            the Mantra may be repeated aloud if one becomes drowsy. Never change
            the Mantra.
          </li>
          <li>
            Repetition will lead to pure thought, in which sound vibration
            merges with thought vibration, without awareness of meaning. Vocal
            repetition progresses through mental repetition to telepathic
            language, and from there to pure thought.

            With practice, duality disappears and Samadhi, or the superconscious
            state, is reached. Do not become impatient, as this takes a long
            time.
          </li>
          <li>
            In Samadhi one rests in the state of Bliss in which the Knower, the
            Knowledge, and the Known become One. This is the superconscious
            state reached by mystics of all faiths and persuasions.

        <Paragraph>
          If you meditate for half an hour daily, you will be able to face life
          with peace and spiritual strength. Meditation is the most powerful
          mental and nerve tonic. Divine energy freely flows to the adept during
          meditation, and exerts a benign influence on the mind, nerves, sense
          organs and body. It opens the door to intuitive knowledge and realms
          of eternal bliss. The mind becomes calm and steady.

        <Heading2>Cleansing Breathing Exercise</Heading2>
        <Paragraph>
          In Sanskrit “Kapala” means skull; “Bhati” means shining. Kapalabhati
          is considered to be so cleansing to the entire system that, when
          practised on a regular basis, the skull (and the face) shine with good
          health and inner radiance. Although a breathing exercise, Kapalabhati
          is technically considered to be one of the “Shad Kriyas” (6 cleansing
          exercises - see “Complete Illustrated Book of Yoga” for further
          information).
        </Paragraph>
        <Heading2>How to do Kapalabhati</Heading2>
        <Paragraph>
          Sit in a cross-legged position with back straight:
        </Paragraph>
        <Paragraph>
          Quickly contract the abdominal muscles pulling the abdomen in sharply,
          exhaling through the nose. The diaphragm is contracted and pulled up
          into the chest cavity, pushing the air out of the lungs.
        </Paragraph>
        <Paragraph>
          Relax the abdominal muscles, allowing the diaphragm to descend to the
          abdominal cavity. The lungs will automatically expand and inflate with
          air.
        </Paragraph>
        <Paragraph>
          If Kapalabhati is done properly, exhalation takes one-fourth of the
          time of inhalation. Passive inhalation and sudden expulsion of breath
          follow each other continuously until a round is completed.
        </Paragraph>
        <Paragraph>
          Beginners may undertake 3 rounds of 20-30 pumpings each. This may
          gradually be increased to 5 rounds of 50-100 pumpings. Make sure that
          the face is kept relaxed. Back and shoulders do not move.

          <li>
            Kapalabhati helps to drain the sinuses and eliminate accumulated
            mucus.
          </li>
          <li>
            Bronchial congestion is removed, as is spasm of the bronchial tubes.

          </li>
          <li>
            As the lungs are cleansed, excess carbon dioxide is eliminated. This
            permits the red-blood cells to suck in more oxygen, increasing the
            richness of blood.
          </li>
          <li>
            The blood is purified and toned; the body gets an increased supply
            of oxygen to all cells.
          </li>
