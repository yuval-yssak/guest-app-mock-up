            The Yogi sees life as a triangle; the body undergoes birth, growth,
            decay, and death. The growth period reaches a plateau at about the
            age of 18-20 years. In the first years of life, the “youthful”
            period, the rate of cell rejuvenation (anabolic) exceeds the rate of
            cell decay (catabolic). In a normal person, the body maintains an
            equilibrium of these processes from the age of 20 until around the
            age of 35, when the decaying, or catabolic process, begins to gain
            precedence. The body machine starts its decline. This process later
            results in “old age” with its accompanying ills and despair.
            However, the Yogis say that we were not born merely to be subject to
            pain and suffering, disease and death. There is a far greater
            purpose to Life. But, the spiritual investigation of Life’s purposes
            requires a keen intellect and a strong will; these are the products
            of a healthy body and mind. For this reason, the ancient sages
            developed an integral system to ward off or retard the decaying or
            catabolic process, and to keep the physical and mental faculties
            strong. This is the system of Yoga, a simple and natural programme
            involving five main principles:

          <Typography>
            Yoga is a life of self-discipline based on the tenets of “simple
            living and high thinking.” <br />
            The body is a temple or a vehicle for the soul, and has specific
            requirements which must be fulfilled for it to function smoothly and
            supply the optimum mileage. These requirements are the same as for
            any vehicle. An automobile requires five things: a lubricating
            system; a battery; a cooling system; fuel; and a responsible driver
            behind the wheel. Now let us look at the human needs.

              <dd>
                acts as a lubricating routine to the joints, muscles, ligaments,
                tendons, and other parts of the body by increasing circulation
                and flexibility. (For further details, see chapter 4 of The
                Complete Illustrated Book of Yoga by Swami Vishnu-devanananda).

              <dd>
                aids the body in connecting to its battery, the Solar Plexus,
                where tremendous potential energy is stored. When tapped through
                specific Yoga breathing techniques (Pranayama), this energy is
                released for physical and mental rejuvenation (see chapter 8 of
                The Complete Illustrated Book of Yoga).

          <Typography variant="h2">1 PROPER EXERCISE</Typography>
          <Typography variant="h3">Asanas</Typography>
          <Typography>
            There are numerous modern physical culture systems designed to
            develop the muscles through mechanical movements and exercises. As
            Yoga regards the body as a vehicle for the soul in its journey
            towards perfection, Asanas (Yogic physical exercise) are designed to
            develop not only the body. They also broaden the mental faculties
            and the spiritual capacities. The fundamental difference between
            Yogic exercises and ordinary physical exercises is that physical
            culture emphasizes violent movement of the muscles; whereas Yogix
            exercises oppose violent muscle movements as they produce large
            quantities of lactic acid in the muscle fibres, thus causing
            fatigue. When practicing asanas, the effect of excess acid and the
            fatigue it causes are neutralized by the alkali in the muscle
            fibres, as well as by the inhalation of oxygen (deep breathing).
            Muscle development does not necessarily mean a healthy body, as is
            commonly assumed. Health is a state wherein all organs function
            perfectly under the intelligent control of the mind. The Yogic
            physical exercises are called “Asanas,” a term which means steady
            pose. This is because the Yogic Asana (or posture) is meant to be
            held for some time. However, this is quite an advanced practice.
            Initially, our concern is simply to increase body flexibility. Your
            body is as young as it is flexible. Yoga exercises focus first on
            the health of the spine, its strength and flexibility. The spinal
            column houses the all-important nervous system, the telegraphic
            system of the body. By maintaining the spine’s flexibility and
            strength through exercise, circulation is increased and the nerves
            are ensured their supply of nutrients and oxygen. Asanas work on the
            integral machinery of the body, the glands and organs, as well as
            the muscles. They affect the deeper and more subtle parts of the
            body. The internal organs receive massage and stimulation through
            the various movements of the Asanas, and are toned into more
            efficient functioning. The endocrine system (glands and hormones) is
            rejuvenated, helping to balance the emotions and improve the mental
            outlook on life. Hand in hand with the practice of yoga postures, we
            practice deep breathing and concentration of the mind. One hour of
            practice will give one hour of exercise, one hour of deep relaxation
            and one hour of meditation - through developing the concentration
            powers within the pose. The Yoga system of exercise can be compared
            to none other in its complete rehauling of the entire being.
            Performed slowly and consciously, the Asanas goe far beyond mere
            physical benefits, becoming a mental exercise in concentration and
            meditation.

          <Typography variant="h2">2 PROPER BREATHING</Typography>

          <Typography variant="h3">Pranayama</Typography>
          <Typography>
            Most people use only a fraction of their lung capacity for
            breathing. They breathe shallowly, barely expanding the ribcage.
            Their shoulders are hunched, they have painful tension in the upper
            parts of the back and neck, and they suffer from lack of oxygen.
            These people become tired easily and don’t know why. Thoughtful
            management and husbanding of breath can be of practical daily aid;
            it can tone up and contribute to health and vitality. Increased
            vital capacity is the object of all breath discipline. Even in a day
            of escalators and elevators there are still stairs to climb. If you
            tire easily when climbing stairs, try this: keeping the shoulder
            blades in position, inhale as you climb the first two steps, and
            exhale on the next two, you can glide up a flight of stairs and
            arrive on the top without grasping for breath. By quickening the
            breath rhythmically while climbing, we expel a greater amount of
            carbon dioxide and take in a great supply of oxygen, thus
            experiencing less fatigue.
          </Typography>

          <Typography variant="h4">Breathe to Live</Typography>
          <Typography>
            What the unfortunate majority of us need these days is a breathing
            programme that can help us at our desks, stoves, and machines.
            Tension and even depression may be overcome by the following
            exercise. Place the shoulder blades as close together as you can
            without strain and exhale gently and fully. Pause, and then inhale
            with a deep, slow, gentle breath until the lungs are comfortably
            filled. Breathe out slowly through the nose with a long sigh and
            without altering the position of the shoulder blades. Do this a
            dozen times and depression will disappear. You will have stimulated
            the brain and eased nerve tension by providing a fuller supply of
            life-giving oxygen. There are three basic types of breathing.
            “Clavicular” breathing is the most shallow and worst possible type.
            The shoulder and collarbone are raised while the abdomen is
            contracted during inhalation. Maximum effort is made, but a minimum
            amount of air is obtained. “Intercostal” breathing is done with the
            rib muscles expanding the rib cage, and is the second type of
            incomplete breathing. “Deep abdominal” breathing is the best, for it
            brings air to the lowest and largest part of the lungs. Breathing is
            slow and deep, and proper use is made of the diaphragm. Actually,
            none of these types are complete. A full Yogic breath combines all
            three, beginning with a deep breath and continuing the inhalation
            through the intercostal and clavicular areas. To get the feel of
            proper diaphragmatic breathing, wear loose clothing and lie on the
            back. Place the hand on the upper abdomen, where the diaphragm is
            located. Breathe in and out slowly. The abdomen should expand
            outward as you inhale and contract as you exhale. Try to get the
            feeling of this motion. Breathe in slowly, expand the abdomen, then
            the ribcage, and finally the upper portion of the lungs. Then,
            breathe out in the same manner, letting the abdomen cave in as you
            exhale. This is the Yogic complete breath.
          </Typography>
          <Typography variant="h4">Pranayama</Typography>
          <Typography>
            By far the most important thing about good breathing is the Prana,
            or subtle energy of the vital breath. Control of the Prana leads to
            control of the mind. Breathing exercises are called Pranayama, which
            means to control the Prana. The grossest manifestation of Prana in
            the human body is the motion of the lungs. This motion acts like the
            flywheel that sets the other forces of the body in motion. Pranayama
            means controlling this motion of the lungs, by which the subtle
            Prana is controlled. When the subtle Prana is controlled, all other
            gross manifestations of Prana in the body with slowly come under
            control. Every part of the body can be filled with Prana, when we
            are able to do this, the whole body will be under our control. All
            diseases of the body can be destroyed at the root by controlling and
            regulating the Prana; this is the secret knowledge of healing. In
            ordinary breathing we extract Prana only very little. But when we
            concentrate and consciously regulate the breathing, we are able to
            store a greater amount. He who has abundant Pranic energy radiates
            vitality and strength, which can be felt by those coming into
            contact with him.

          <Typography variant="h2">3 PROPER RELAXATION</Typography>
          <Typography variant="h3">Savasana</Typography>

          <Typography>
            When the body and the mind are constantly overworked, their natural
            efficiency to perform work diminishes. Modern social life, food,
            work and even the so called entertainment, such as disco dancing,
            make it difficult for modern people to relax. Many have even
            forgotten that rest and relaxation are Nature’s way of recharging.
            Even while trying to rest, the average person expends a lot of
            physical and mental energy through tension. Much of the body’s
            energy is wasted uselessly. More of our energy is spent is keeping
            the muscles in continual readiness for work than in the actual
            useful work done. In order to regulate and balance the work of the
            body and mind, it is best to learn to economize the energy produced
            by our body. This may be done by learning to relax.
          </Typography>
          <Typography>
            It may be remembered that in the course of one day, our body usually
            produces all the substances and energy necessary for the next day.
            But it often happens that all these substances and energy may be
            consumed within a few minutes by bad moods, anger, injury, or
            intense irritation. The process of eruption and repression of
            violent emotions often grows into a regular habit. The result is
            disastrous not only for the body, but also for the mind. During
            complete relaxation, there is practically no energy or “Prana” being
            consumed, although a little is kept in circulation to keep the body
            in normal condition while the remaining portion is being stored and
            conserved. In order to achieve perfect relaxation, three methods are
            used by Yogis: “physical,” “mental” and “spiritual” relaxation.
            Relaxation is not complete until the person reaches that stage of
            spiritual relaxation, which only advanced Spiritual Aspirants know.
          </Typography>
          <Typography variant="h4">3A Physical Relaxation</Typography>
          <Typography>
            We all know that every action is the result of thought. Thoughts
            take form in action, the body reacting to the thought. Just as the
            mind may send a message to the muscles ordering them to contract,
            the mind may also send another message to bring the relaxation to
            the tired muscles.
          </Typography>
          <Typography>
            Physical relaxation first begins with the toes and then moves
            upward. The autosuggestion passes through the muscles and reaches
            the eyes and ears at the top. Then, slowly, messages are sent to the
            kidneys, liver and the other internal organs. This relaxation
            position is known as Savasan, or the “Corpse Pose.” (For further
            reading, please see chapter 6 of “The Complete Illustrated Book of
            Yoga” by Swami Vishnu-devananda).

          <Typography variant="h4">3B Mental Relaxation</Typography>
          <Typography>
            When experiencing mental tension, it is advisable to breathe slowly
            and rhythmically for a few minutes. Soon the mind will become calm.
            You may experience a kind of floating sensation.
          </Typography>
          <Typography variant="h4">3C Spiritual Relaxation</Typography>
          <Typography>
            However one may try to relax the mind, all tensions and worries
            cannot be completely removed until one reaches spiritual relaxation.
            As long as a person identifies with the body and mind, there will be
            worries, sorrows, anxieties, fear and anger. These emotions, in
            turn, bring tension. Yogis know that unless a person can withdraw
            from the body/mind idea and separate himself from the
            ego-consciousness, there is no way of obtaining completion
            relaxation.
          </Typography>
          <Typography>
            The Yogi identifies himself with the all-pervading, all-powerful,
            all-peaceful and joyful Self, or pure Consciousness within. He knows
            that the source of all power, knowledge, peace, and strength is in
            the Self, not in the body. We tune to this by asserting the real
            nature, that is “I am that pure Consciousness or Self.” This
            identification with the Self completes the process of relaxation.
          </Typography>

          <Typography variant="h2">4 PROPER DIET</Typography>
          <Typography variant="h3">Vegetarian</Typography>
          <Typography>
            The Yogic diet is a vegetarian one, consisting of pure, simple,
            natural foods which are easily digested and promote health. Simple
            meals aid the digestion and assimilation of foods. Nutritional
            requirements fall under five categories: protein, carbohydrates,
            minerals, fats and vitamins. One should have a certain knowledge of
            dietetics in order to balance their diet. Eating foods first-hand
            from nature, grown in fertile soil (preferably organic, free from
            chemicals and pesticides) will help ensure a better supply of these
            nutritional needs. Processing, refining, and overcooking destroy
            much food value.
          </Typography>
          <Typography>
            There is a cycle in Nature known as the “food cycle” or “food
            chain”. The Sun is the source of energy for all life on our planet;
            it nourished the plants (the top of the food chain) which are then
            eaten by animals (vegetarian), which are then eaten by other animals
            (carnivores).
          </Typography>
          <Typography>
            The food at the top of the food chain, being directly nourished by
            the Sun, has the greatest life promoting properties. The food value
            of animal flesh is termed a “second-hand” source of nutrition, and
            is inferior in nature. All natural foods (fruits, vegetables, seeds,
            nuts and grains) have, in varying quantities, different proportions
            of these essential nutrients.
          </Typography>
          <Typography>
            As a source of protein, these are easily assimilated by the body.
            However, second-hand sources are often more difficult to digest and
            are of less value to the body’s metabolism.
          </Typography>
          <Typography>
            Many people worry about whether they are getting enough protein, but
            neglect other factors. The quality of the protein is more important
            than the quantity alone. Dairy products, legumes, nuts and seeds
            provide the vegetarian with an adequate supply of protein. The high
            protein requirement still being used by many Health Departments is
            based on antiquated data and has been scientifically disproved many
            times in the laboratory.
          </Typography>
          <Typography>
            A healthy motto is: “Eat to live, not live to eat.” It is best if we
            understand that the purpose of eating is to supply our being with
            the lifeforce, or Prana, the vital life energy. So the greatest
            nutritional plan for the Yoga student is the simple diet of natural
            fresh foods.
          </Typography>
          <Typography>
            However, the true Yogic diet is actually even more selective than
            this. The Yogi is concerned with the subtle effect that food has on
            his mind and astral body. He therefore avoids foods which are overly
            stimulating, preferring those which rener the mind calme and the
            intellect sharp. One who seriously takes to the path of Yoga would
            avoid ingesting meats, fish, eggs, garlic, coffee, tea (except
            herbal), alcohol and drugs.

            Any change in diet should be made gradually. Start by substituting
            larger portions of vegetables, grains, seeds and nuts until finally
            all flesh products have been completely eliminated from the diet.

            The Yogic diet will help you to attain a high standard of health,
            keen intellect and serenity of mind.

                Regularity of time, place and practice are most important.
                Regularity conditions the mind to slow down its activities with
                a minimum of delay

                The most effective times are ealy dawn and dusk, when the
                atmosphere is charged with special spiritual force. If it is not
                feasible to sit for meditation at these times, choose an hour
                when you are not involved with daily activities, and a time when
                the mind is apt to be calm.
