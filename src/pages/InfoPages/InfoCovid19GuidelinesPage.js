      <h2>TRAVEL REQUIREMENTS FOR ENTERING THE BAHAMAS</h2>
      <p>
        To assist with preventing the spread of COVID-19 and reduce the risk of
        exposure, registered guests will need to follow these government
        protocols:

      <ol>
        <li>
          Everyone traveling to The Bahamas must obtain a negative COVID-19
          RT-PCR (swab) test taken no more than five (5) days prior to their
          arrival date in The Bahamas. Children 10 and under are not required to
          take a test.
          <ol type="a" style={{ paddingLeft: '1rem' }}>
            <li>
              Once a negative COVID-19 RT-PCR (swab) test is obtained, travelers
              can apply for their required Bahamas Travel Health Visa at
              travel.gov.bs.

              All visitors are required to opt-in to mandatory COVID-19 health
              insurance when applying for their Travel Health Visa. The
              insurance will cover travelers for COVID-19 related medical
              expenses for the duration of their stay in The Bahamas. To learn
              more about The Bahamas Travel Health Visa and health insurance,

            </li>
            <li>
              The cost of the Travel Health Visa is dependent on the length of
              stay and is subject to change.

      <h3>What if a guest or Staff shows symptoms consistent with COVID?</h3>

        quarantine on site immediately and for a period of 14 days. All recently

        members will be asked to test as well. Contact tracing is part of the
        protocol, so if a suspected or confirmed case does occur, we will notify
